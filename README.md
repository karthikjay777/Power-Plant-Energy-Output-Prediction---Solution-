# Power-Plant-Energy-Output-Prediction---Solution-

This file consists the solution to a hackathon which was conducted by MachineHack. Apparently, this code got me in 5th position.


Attribute Information:

Features consist of hourly average ambient variables

1. Temperature (T) in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C
2. Ambient Pressure (AP) in the range 992.89-1033.30 millibar
3. Relative Humidity (RH) in the range of 25.56% to 100.16%
4. Exhaust Vacuum (V) in the range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg
5. Net hourly electrical energy output (PE) 420.26-495.76 MW

The averages are taken from various sensors located around the plant that record the ambient variables every second. The variables are given without normalization.
